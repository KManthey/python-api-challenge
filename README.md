Purpose Summary:

WeatherPy
Visualize the weather 500 cities across the world of varying distance from the equator, showing relationships between various weather conditions.
Scatter plots will explore the relationships betweem latitude and maximum tempuratures, humidity, cloudiness and windspeed. Linear regression will
explore these relationships separated by hemisphere.

VacationPy
WeatherPy data is filtered based on my ideal weather preferences to produce a list of cities I may wish to vacation in.  A heatmap displays the
humidity for each city.  Hotels are located within 5000 meters from each city and are then pinned onto the heatmap.
